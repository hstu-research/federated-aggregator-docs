It does not configure a workflow, package, or credential and does not create an image or registry route. Azure read-only checks still show Core live/ready health and the aggregation worker disabled marker, but do not prove Agent image or platform readiness. Actual execution still requires a one-candidate authorization, protected-environment configuration, private package verification, immutable external evidence, a target-staging dossier, and a security-critical confirmation. No training, update, submission, provider contact, or aggregation-worker activation is permitted.</p><CheckCircle2 size={24} /></section>
