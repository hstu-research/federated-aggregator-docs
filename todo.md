# Active Work

- [x] Configure the documentation and future core repositories to use the user's Git name and email for all new commits.
- [x] Add the documentation-ledger convention to the project governance record.
- [x] Research stakeholders, governance context, federated-learning practice, and model-release needs.
- [x] Write the non-technical aggregator-core requirements analysis: user, business, research, governance, risk, and opportunity requirements.
- [x] Add the requirements analysis, decision record, research-log entry, and open questions to the documentation site.
- [ ] Commit and push the documentation update using the user's configured Git identity.
- [ ] Deliver the analysis and identify the next architecture decision gate.

## GitHub Organization Migration to hstu-research

- [x] Inventory every organization-bound reference across the Core, documentation, administrator portal, thesis, Git remotes, GitHub Actions, deployment workflows, and hosted-service configuration.
- [x] Transfer `federated-aggregator-core`, `federated-aggregator-docs`, `federated-aggregator-admin-portal`, and `thesis_breast_cancer` to `hstu-research` while preserving repository visibility, history, and default branches.
- [x] Update local repository remotes, active source metadata, CI/CD and deployment documentation, Render source settings, and documentation links to make `hstu-research` authoritative. The Azure workflow remains repository-local, so no Azure source URL rewrite was required.
- [x] Verify the transferred repository URLs, GitHub Actions visibility, Azure deployment source path, Core Quality Gates run 31, protected Azure deployment run 16, and the Render documentation build from `hstu-research/federated-aggregator-docs` commit `3a8e65b`; record the result in the public research chronology and publish a documentation checkpoint.

## Bounded Aggregation Callback and Redis Resilience Evidence

- [x] Read the current public decision ledger and Core contracts to define one synthetic federation, protocol, round, verified descriptor set, aggregation job, callback, and evidence query. Synthetic archive bytes remained worker-local/object-storage-only; no patient data, clinical images, credentials, bearer tokens, raw provider responses, or storage locators entered the ledger.
- [x] Add the profile-gated `bounded-aggregation-validation` Azure harness and operator runbook. The runner creates synthetic control-plane records, dispatches one job through the real outbox path, waits for descriptor-only reconciliation, and emits only safe identifiers, lifecycle states, digests, checksum, and byte-size evidence.
- [x] Temporarily set `AGGREGATION_WORKER_ENABLED=true` only for the bounded synthetic test, repair the missing private callback URL and non-root OIDC-secret handoff found during the first controlled attempt, verify the real worker result as `succeeded|candidate_ready|enqueued|accepted`, then immediately restore the default disabled gate and its explicit log state.
- [x] Run a separate disposable Redis primary/two-replica/three-Sentinel fault-injection exercise. It observed primary loss and a final `subjectively_down` state but no promotion during the bounded window; the test topology was removed and the current direct-URL Core path remains explicitly non-Sentinel-aware.
- [x] Record the bounded callback and Sentinel evidence in the public chronology, keep all secrets and raw provider responses out of the ledger, apply the indexed-archive presentation refinements, and publish a documentation checkpoint.

## Next Federated System: Documentation-First Autonomous Delivery

- [x] Review the completed Core ledger, existing administrator portal, thesis materials, and supplied research sources to select the separate Hospital Node Agent boundary without duplicating the Core control plane.
- [x] Publish an in-depth non-technical requirements analysis covering users, hospital operating model, research value, clinical-data boundary, governance, risks, and measurable outcomes for the Hospital Node Agent.
- [x] Publish the matching technical requirements analysis, logical schema, lifecycle and exception flows, system architecture, modular engineering standards, workflow design, proposed workload API contract reference, and AI-ready implementation handoff.
- [x] Create `hstu-research/federated-aggregator-hospital-node`, establish its tested synthetic baseline at `cfcf1dc`, and retain integration exclusively through the Core’s proposed descriptor, command, and workload-identity boundaries.
- [x] Add restart-safe local SQLite run state at `2468f4b` with unique assignment/idempotency identity, append-only event labels, terminal-run recovery, and in-process fake Core adapters; Hospital Node Quality Gates #2 passed in 18 seconds. No local status route, data path, token, object locator, artifact byte, patient field, or Core network integration was added.
- [x] Add in-memory scoped capability, checksum, token, remote-outcome, and fake storage guards at `deee8a6` and `1dcff80`; Hospital Node Quality Gates #3 and #4 passed. The work proves only synthetic contract behavior—no Azure/Core call, capability URL, automatic retry, persistent credential, raw byte API, or hospital data path was introduced.
- [x] Add the opt-in localhost-only synthetic status read and static Compose test profile at `e11d661`; Quality Gates #5 passed in 20 seconds. The direct loopback response is tested; Docker is unavailable in this sandbox, so no container runtime proof or public deployment is claimed.
- [x] Specify the additive Core hospital-node workload contract before integration: distinct audience/guard, participation-gated assignment and lease lifecycle, descriptor-only artifact intent/submission, safe event/audit schema, test sequence, and bounded Azure synthetic proof. Existing human and `ml_worker` routes remain prohibited.
- [x] Implement and deploy the first Core policy-only slice at `79bdcee`: hospital-node assignment/lease vocabulary, state transitions, lease eligibility, repository port, and deterministic denials. Full local CI, Core Quality Gates, Azure deployment, and public liveness/readiness passed; no migration, HTTP route, capability, credential, node call, or worker activation was added.
- [x] Implement and deploy the additive Core persistence foundation at `31e7588`: constrained assignment/lease/safe-event schema plus migration `0010`, unique assignment/idempotency controls, and descriptor-only columns. Full local CI, Core Quality Gates, Azure deployment, and public liveness/readiness passed; no adapter, API route, capability, Keycloak client, node call, hospital data, or worker activation was added.
- [x] Implement and deploy `HospitalNodeAuthGuard` at `92c6c53`: distinct `fedagg-hospital-node` audience, active workload hydration, and hospital-node-kind enforcement with ML-worker denial. Full local CI, Core Quality Gates, Azure deployment, and public liveness/readiness passed; no controller, Keycloak client, token, route, capability, node call, hospital data, or worker activation was added.
- [x] Implement and deploy `PostgresHospitalNodeAssignmentRepository` at `263e596`: exact workload/participant context, idempotent lease recovery, one-active-lease database index, assigned-to-leased compare-and-set, and scalar-only lease event. Full local CI, Core Quality Gates, Azure deployment, and public liveness/readiness passed; no controller, Keycloak client, immutable command, capability, update/submission route, node call, hospital data, or worker activation was added.
- [x] Document the canonical-command prerequisite before lease-route work: Core must persist the Agent-validated descriptor-only `hospital-node-command/v1` payload plus Core-computed digest because existing protocol digest metadata cannot reconstruct it. The future payload excludes locators, credentials, bytes, paths, free text, and patient data.
- [x] Implement and deploy the first dedicated hospital-node lease route at `0fd4e4b`: `HospitalNodeAuthGuard` only, principal-derived workload binding, UUID idempotency key, and lease receipt plus stored descriptor-only command. Full local CI, Core Quality Gates, Azure deployment, and public liveness/readiness passed; the route was not invoked because no node Keycloak client or assignment exists, and no capability, artifact transfer, submission, data, or worker change was added.
- [x] Design the bounded endpoint proof before configuration: a distinct private `hospital-node-synthetic` OIDC client/secret/audience/claim, opt-in Core-network profile, generated synthetic assignment/command, one lease call, and immediate fixture non-reuse. ML-worker identity and aggregation-worker activation remain prohibited.
- [x] Validate the initial slice against the Core test environment and record the bounded lease evidence in the public ledger: Core `7d9218c` deployed successfully; the separate private synthetic client acquired a token; one generated assignment received one descriptor-only lease; the fixture closed as one expired assignment, zero active assignments/leases, and one safe closure event; Azure liveness/readiness remained HTTP 200 and the aggregation worker stayed disabled.
- [x] Document the next Core gate before implementation: a narrowly privileged synthetic assignment-creation authority, including frozen-fact eligibility, idempotency, audit, expiry, and denial tests. Do not implement model-read capability, update intent, artifact transfer, or submission until that design is accepted.
- [x] Increment A — Publish the assignment-creation authority contract: explicit principal, input shape, frozen-fact source, canonical-command ownership, idempotency, safe event/outbox evidence, expiry/terminal handling, and denial matrix.
- [x] Increment B — Implement only the documented synthetic assignment-creation authority with deterministic domain/application/persistence tests; retain every human route, ML-worker identity, artifact capability, transfer, training, and submission path as unavailable. Core `a0f423b` added the private service/port/domain/adapter boundary and 10 new TypeScript tests.
- [x] Increment C — Pass Core quality gates and protected Azure deployment; verify liveness/readiness and the default-disabled aggregation worker before any bounded runtime exercise. Quality passed in 1 minute 41 seconds; protected Azure deployment passed in 3 minutes 1 second; liveness/readiness were HTTP 200 and the worker stayed disabled.
- [x] Increment D — Record deployment evidence and define the next safe boundary before any new implementation work.
- [x] Increment E — Publish the bounded creation-only composition-proof contract: a new private profile/runner must compose the service for generated facts, prove exact replay, and close the fixture without token, endpoint, lease, capability, transfer, submission, dispatch, or worker activation.
- [x] Increment F — Implement the documented creation-only profile, runner, and deterministic tests; deploy `0b48aeb`, then run it once only after Azure health and default-disabled worker verification. The proof closed as one expired synthetic assignment, zero active assigned/leased records, one closure event, and zero remaining runners.
- [x] Increment G — Publish the descriptor-only base-model-read intent contract: lease-bound node-only issuance, Core-owned model descriptor mapping prerequisite, additive receipt/state/event design, exact replay, redaction, and no-storage-access proof requirements.
- [x] Increment H0 — Publish the missing Core-owned verified base-model descriptor mapping contract and additive schema prerequisite. The current `rounds.baseModelVersionId` is an opaque string and the current artifact categories do not represent a verified base-model archive, so it cannot safely support a node read-intent yet.
- [x] Increment H1 — Implement and deploy only the documented verified base-model descriptor mapping plus persistence tests. Core `9fce888` added migration `0012`, immutable descriptor/event persistence, exact replay/conflict tests, and a private service; 68 TypeScript and 9 Python tests, quality/deployment, Azure health, and the disabled-worker gate passed. No mapping runtime profile ran.
- [x] Increment H2 — Resume the documented base-model-read intent boundary only after H1 mapping evidence is recorded and accepted.
- [x] Increment I — Implement only the documented lease-bound, HospitalNodeAuthGuard-only descriptor receipt for base-model-read intent issuance plus its migration, redaction, atomicity, and guard tests. Core `d9b55fc` added migration `0013`, the guarded receipt route, domain/application/persistence/controller coverage, and 77 TypeScript plus 9 Python tests. Quality/deployment, Azure health, and disabled-worker checks passed; no runtime intent request occurred.
- [x] Increment J0 — Publish the one-shot descriptor-intent issuance-and-expiry proof profile contract before implementation. It must use generated facts only, issue one intent through the guarded Core route, assert redaction, expire the intent/lease/assignment, append safe closure evidence, and never contact storage or enable the aggregation worker.
- [x] Increment J1 — Implement and deploy the documented opt-in descriptor-intent proof profile/runner. The profile later issued and expired one guarded descriptor-only intent through the rebuilt validation runner; the successful route proof is recorded in J1d.
- [x] Increment J1a — Record the pre-route duplicate-workload discovery and correction: the existing separate synthetic workload mapping must be reused rather than duplicated. The initial profile transaction rolled back before any guarded request or read-intent write.
- [x] Increment J1b — Implement, quality-check, and deploy the mapping-reuse correction. Core `261a639` passed local quality, Core Quality Gates, and protected Azure deployment; the source has not yet been executed because the next Compose run reused a stale local profile image.
- [x] Increment J1c — Publish the explicit runner-image rebuild requirement. The prior correction release activated successfully, but Compose reused the old local profile image; that stale image repeated the pre-route duplicate workload failure and rolled back before the guarded route.
- [x] Increment J1d — Recheck Azure health/default-disabled worker, then perform one `run --build` validation with the corrected runner. The rebuilt runner issued and expired one descriptor-only intent; closure evidence was one expired assignment, zero active leases, zero issued intents, one closure event, zero runner instances, HTTP 200 liveness/readiness, and disabled worker.
- [x] Increment J2 — Publish the next Core-mediated model-stream authorization design gate and its no-locator/no-credential/no-transfer-before-proof constraints.
- [x] Increment J3 — Produce the full requirements, schema, workflow, architecture, engineering-standard, API, and implementation-handoff dossier for Core-mediated generated-model streaming before any stream endpoint, Agent download, or local training integration is implemented.
- [x] Increment K1 — Publish the complete Core-mediated generated-model streaming dossier: nontechnical and technical requirements, data/schema, workflow, architecture, engineering rules, API contract, test plan, and implementation handoff.
- [x] Increment K2 — Implement only the reviewed Core-mediated stream boundary for a generated non-clinical fixture, retaining no storage locator/credential disclosure, no Agent integration, no training, no update/submission, and no worker enablement. Core `d3516e4` added the guarded full-body route, private adapter/repository/session state, migration `0014`, and 83 TypeScript plus 9 Python tests.
- [x] Increment K3 — Pass Core quality gates and protected Azure deployment, then verify liveness/readiness and the default-disabled aggregation worker before any bounded stream execution. Quality passed in 1 minute 55 seconds; protected Azure deployment passed in 2 minutes 46 seconds; Azure health remained HTTP 200 and the worker remained disabled.
- [x] Increment K4 — Run one generated-fixture stream proof, record only safe aggregate evidence, close the intent, and confirm no runner or active proof state remains. Core `707cf23` passed local quality, Core Quality Gates run `32567581955`, and protected Azure deployment run `32567581950`; the rebuilt profile ran once and closed with one completed stream session, one consumed intent, zero active sessions/intents/leases, one closure event, zero runner containers, HTTP 200 health, and the default-disabled aggregation worker.
- [x] Increment K5 — Publish the evidence and document the next safe boundary before connecting any Agent download or local training flow. The public ledger now records the bounded Core stream proof; the next gate is the Agent receipt-verification and synthetic-local-persistence dossier.
- [x] Increment K2a — Record deployment evidence for the reviewed Core-mediated stream boundary and publish the exact generated-fixture profile contract before writing a runner.
- [x] Increment K2b — Implement and deploy the isolated stream validation profile/runner. Core `707cf23` passed local quality, Core Quality Gates, and protected Azure deployment; its one rebuilt invocation generated a non-clinical fixture through Core-private setup, called the node-only stream route once, verified hash/length/redaction privately, closed state, and exposed no storage credential or locator.
- [x] Increment L1 — Publish the Agent receipt-verification and synthetic-local-persistence dossier before any Agent code changes. It defines local requirements, schema, workflow, architecture, engineering standards, typed Core-client boundary, AI handoff, tests, and a future bounded proof without authorizing training.
- [x] Increment L2 — Implement only the documented Agent receipt/value contracts and local SQLite receipt/event persistence. Agent `a9561ff` adds the local-only contracts, pure state matrix, additive SQLite receipt/materialization/event persistence, idempotency, terminality, restart coverage, and 17 TypeScript plus 4 Python passing tests. No Core HTTP adapter, workspace materialization, token flow, training, update, submission, aggregation, or Azure Agent proof occurred.
- [x] Increment L2a — Add versioned scalar-safe receipt/materialization/event contracts and pure state-transition tests. `a9561ff` rejects unexpected token, URL, locator/version, provider response, raw header/body, workspace path, byte payload, local-data, and free-text diagnostic fields; exact/mismatched observed facts and terminal transition denial are tested.
- [x] Increment L2b — Add an additive SQLite migration/repository that atomically persists immutable expected receipt facts, materialization outcomes, and allowlisted events. `a9561ff` covers exact issue replay, terminal immutability, and restart-safe rejection recovery without any network or workspace adapter.
- [x] Increment L3 — After L2 evidence, implement the document-defined local verification use case and fake generated-fixture workspace adapter with integrity, cleanup, redaction, and restart tests. Agent `ec217dd` passes local CI with 21 TypeScript and 4 Python tests; no real Core client, token, HTTP request, filesystem, storage, Azure, training, update, submission, or aggregation occurred.
- [x] Increment L3a — Add a local application use case that consumes only a validated scalar receipt and generated in-memory bytes, computes exact checksum/byte-size/content-type equality, persists a terminal observation through L2, and returns a redacted scalar result. `ec217dd` adds `verifyBaseModelReceiptLocally` with no Core, OIDC, HTTP, storage, Python, trainer, update, or submission import.
- [x] Increment L3b — Add an in-memory fake generated-fixture workspace adapter with temporary/promoted/cleaned lifecycle tests. `ec217dd` proves exact-match promotion, mismatch cleanup, interruption cleanup, redacted scalar output, and terminal-replay workspace suppression without filesystem, network, or Azure use.
- [ ] Increment L4 — After L3 evidence, design and implement the typed hospital-node Core client plus private workspace adapter, then pass quality/deployment gates before a separately documented one-shot Agent/Core proof.
- [x] Increment L4a — Publish the typed Hospital Node Core-client and private workspace adapter contract before code. The new L4 dossier specifies the separate workload-token seam, two allowed Core routes, full-body response classification, no redirect/Range/raw-body projection, private workspace lifecycle, status taxonomy, observability/redaction, compatibility fixtures, quality gates, and a later proof plan.
- [x] Increment L4b — Implement only deterministic fake typed Core-client and fake private-workspace adapters against the L4 contract. Agent `afc98d1` passes local CI with 25 TypeScript and 4 Python tests; it covers allowed sequencing, route/status denial, full-body fact projection, no provider fields, no raw headers/bodies/tokens/paths, and workspace cleanup compensation without a socket, token source, provider client, filesystem, Azure resource, trainer, update, submission, or aggregation worker.
- [x] Increment L4c — Publish a concrete-adapter review record before real implementation: configuration ownership, separate token-port wiring, fixed Core host/route allowlist, response validator/error map, private-root permissions, cleanup-failure handling, compatibility checks, deployment posture, and a later proof precondition. The L4 dossier now records this review without a real Core request or Azure Agent run.
- [x] Increment L4c1 — Define a non-runtime transport review artifact: injected configuration shape without values, hospital-node token-port ownership, fixed Core route construction, no-redirect/no-Range/no-encoding policy, safe response classification, log redaction, and compatibility fixtures. Agent `6cb6662` adds deterministic configuration/route/response review values and tests without fetch, token, environment, or network code.
- [x] Increment L4c2 — Define a non-runtime private-workspace review artifact: injected private-root ownership, restrictive permission lifecycle, temporary/promoted/discarded cleanup matrix, crash/restart/cleanup-failure posture, pathless capability projection, and negative test matrix. Agent `6cb6662` adds type-only root/permission/lifecycle review values and tests without filesystem or path persistence.
- [x] Increment L4d — Implement concrete typed Core and private workspace adapters only after L4c is public and locally reviewed. Agent `ec1c98f` passes local CI with 33 TypeScript and 4 Python tests; it remains behind injected doubles and does not deploy or call Core.
- [x] Increment L4d1 — Implement a concrete typed Core transport behind injected request and workload-token ports. `ec1c98f` enforces closed HTTPS/two-route behavior, internal token containment, redirect/Range/encoding/body denial, bounded response validation, scalar-safe error mapping, and no raw transport projection. Tests use deterministic request/token doubles only; no actual Core request.
- [x] Increment L4d2 — Implement a concrete private filesystem workspace behind an injected filesystem port. `ec1c98f` validates private-root readiness, requires exclusive temporary creation, streams/hashes/counts with bounds, promotes through the injected port, compensates a failed persistence step, and returns only receipt-scoped scalar capability. Tests use an in-memory filesystem double only; no host filesystem action.
- [ ] Increment L4e — Publish a separate deployment and bounded-proof dossier before any production wiring or runtime invocation: concrete request-port/token-source/filesystem adapter ownership, protected Agent release posture, compatibility gates, redacted health/preflight/closure record, one opt-in generated-fixture proof, and explicit no-training/no-submission/no-aggregation limits.
- [x] Increment L4e1 — Publish the full deployment-and-proof dossier before runtime wiring: nontechnical/technical requirements, deployment configuration ownership, identity/transport/filesystem adapter mapping, protected release checks, redacted preflight/readout, one-shot generated-fixture workflow, aggregate closure, failure/retry policy, tests, AI handoff, and explicit stop conditions. The new L4e dossier records all of these as design-only constraints.
- [x] Increment L4e2 — Implement and locally validate protected Agent runtime wiring only after L4e1 is public. Agent `ea97b69` adds the no-port/no-default/no-restart preflight Compose profile, opaque reference validation, scalar-safe readout, and 35 TypeScript plus 4 Python passing tests. No profile invocation occurs until release/health/worker gates are confirmed.
- [ ] Increment L4e3 — Run one generated-fixture Agent/Core proof only after Agent and Core quality/deployment, release identity, liveness/readiness, aggregation-disabled, and preflight gates are recorded. Agent `8e53c22` and Core `a64488d` source gates are green; Core Azure health is 200/200 and worker disabled, but no target Agent proof composition exists. The proof is safely blocked pre-route until L4e2c–L4e2e topology/release work completes. Use one rebuilt opt-in profile and publish safe terminal closure before any retry.
- [x] Increment L4e2a — Publish a private Core-to-Agent proof-handoff coordination contract before cross-repository runtime wiring. The new coordination dossier defines Core-created generated context, narrow ephemeral handoff, independent lease-first Agent consumption, scalar result, closure, no discovery/public exposure/storage bypass, and safe aggregate evidence.
- [x] Increment L4e2b — Implement only the documented coordination components and deterministic local contract tests after L4e2a is public. Core `a64488d` adds strict pure handoff/result validators with 67 TypeScript and 9 Python passing tests; Agent `8e53c22` adds fake-first lease/intent/stream/workspace orchestration with 37 TypeScript and 4 Python passing tests. No target runtime, live secret, Core/Azure request, provider, training, update, submission, or aggregation occurred.
- [x] Increment L4e2c — Implement a Core-private one-shot coordination runner behind typed handoff/result channel ports. Core `669b1e0` passed local quality (69 TypeScript tests, 9 Python tests), Core Quality Gates, and protected deployment. It uses injected fakes only; no fixture, storage, route, locator, provider, token, header/body, or worker change occurs in this increment.
- [x] Increment L4e2d — Implement an Agent one-shot runtime runner behind concrete token/request/filesystem/channel ports. Agent `03576b1` passed local CI with 39 TypeScript and 4 Python tests and Hospital Node Quality Gates. It validates one protected handoff and delegates only through injected ports; no target invocation occurs.
- [x] Increment L4e2e — Add a protected composite profile with directional ephemeral private channels, no public port/default activation/restart/host bind, opaque secret references, and static configuration checks. Agent `ad3e624` provides a non-executing topology template with these source constraints; target rendering/release binding remains required before any run.
- [ ] Increment L4e2c1 — Add Core-private channel port and one-shot coordinator state machine with strict handoff/result validation, bounded wait, single-result acceptance, closure callback, and fake-only tests. Do not create a fixture, touch storage/database, read a secret, or invoke a target runtime.
- [ ] Increment L4e2d1 — Add Agent runtime channel, token, request, and workspace adapters with injected fakes and a one-shot runner composition test. Keep all output scalar-safe; do not execute real filesystem, OIDC, HTTP, Core, provider, or Azure activity.
- [ ] Increment L4e2e1 — Add an opt-in cross-repository composition manifest/source template with directional ephemeral channels and protected references. Validate source constraints locally; do not run it until target release/preflight checks are green.
- [ ] Increment L4e2f — Publish and implement a bounded generated-context port behind injected deterministic fakes only. It must accept one prevalidated generated-context record, deny reuse/invalid terminal state, and return scalar-safe handoff facts; it must not create a fixture, call a database/storage/provider, read a secret, acquire a token, or invoke a runtime.
- [ ] Increment L4e2g — Publish and implement a bounded private wait port behind injected deterministic fakes only. It must cap polls/delay, surface timeout/interruption as a scalar terminal condition, and never schedule retry, read configuration, open a network connection, or run a target profile.
- [ ] Increment L4e2h — After L4e2f/g evidence, compose a source-only Core proof-runner entrypoint with explicit opt-in and injected ports. Do not add a target Compose service, fixture setup, identity source, database/storage/provider dependency, public route, training, submission, or aggregation change.
- [x] Workflow Skill S1 — Package the reusable documentation-first bounded federated-system workflow, chronological public-ledger requirements, safe autonomy rules, and validation/checkpoint pattern as an installable skill. The package includes the boundary checklist, staged delivery sequence, Core/Agent artifact-delivery guardrails, autonomous progression rules, and a redacted bounded-proof template.
- [x] Workflow Skill S2 — Validate the skill package, publish a ledger record of its scope, and attach the installable skill without exposing any project secrets, provider details, raw data, or internal paths. Validation passed after installing the validator’s missing YAML dependency; the skill is ready for delivery as a reusable package.

- [x] Validate full CI: formatting, lint, TypeScript, PostgreSQL migration/integration execution, 39 TypeScript tests, and 4 Python tests; build the portal and preserve its review-only disposal boundary until a safe Core summary exists.
- [x] Commit/push Core and portal milestones under the user Git identity, record the public chronology, and checkpoint the documentation site.
- [ ] Queue the matching Notion ledger update for retry after the unavailable connector/browser transport recovers.

## Product-Core Phase 10 Stale Disposal Recovery

- [x] Research idempotent outbox recovery and preserve the rule that an unknown storage outcome must be recorded, not automatically retried.[6]
- [x] Add the `recovery_pending_verification` lifecycle state, an additive immutable recovery-evidence table, a fixed minimum age, platform-admin authorization, required reason, and protected Core command.
- [x] Keep recovery redacted in the portal lifecycle summary; do not add a browser recovery or storage execution control.
- [x] Validate Core CI: formatting, lint, type checking, recovery service tests, PostgreSQL migration/integration execution, 40 TypeScript tests, and 4 Python tests; validate the portal production build.
- [x] Commit/push Core and portal changes under the user Git identity, record the public chronology, and checkpoint the documentation ledger.

## Product-Core Phase 11 Deployment Attestations

- [x] Research deployment-attestation and distributed rate-limit validation constraints while treating provider evidence as a controlled reference rather than a live-cloud claim.[7]
- [x] Add a Core schema, migration, application service, PostgreSQL adapter, platform-admin record path, federation-owner safe-summary read, audit/outbox evidence, and protected API routes.
- [x] Keep the public/browser-safe summary limited to scope, assurance label, evidence digest, and review time; exclude raw provider configuration, credentials, evidence references, artifact/model bytes, and patient data.
- [x] Extend the portal with a protected deployment-evidence count only; do not add a browser recording control.
- [x] Validate full Core CI (42 TypeScript plus 4 Python tests), PostgreSQL migration/integration execution, and portal production build; commit/push with the user Git identity.
- [x] Record the chronology and checkpoint the documentation ledger.

## Product-Core Phase 12 Provider-Verification Resolution

- [x] Research bounded provider verification and retain the distinction between an observed object state and a sanitization/compliance conclusion.[8] [9]
- [x] Add immutable resolution evidence for recovery-pending disposal with the only permitted outcome categories: `object_absent`, `object_present`, and `provider_unavailable`.
- [x] Require platform-admin authorization, a bounded reference/digest, correlation evidence, and privileged-operation throttling; do not invoke storage, retry deletion, or reuse old approvals from the resolution path.
- [x] Extend the portal only to recognize redacted verification lifecycle states; do not expose evidence references, provider responses, locators, versions, or a browser resolution control.
- [x] Validate Core CI (43 TypeScript plus 4 Python tests), PostgreSQL migration/integration execution, and portal production build; commit/push Core and portal updates under the user Git identity.
- [x] Record the chronology and checkpoint the documentation ledger.
- [ ] Phase 13: Add attestation review/expiry policy, real multi-instance Redis-unavailable validation, and deployed Collector/backend/alert-receiver testing while retaining the no-automatic-retry rule.

## Product-Core Phase 13 Attestation Freshness Policy

- [x] Research bounded attestation review/expiry policy and distributed Redis/Collector validation requirements.[10] [11]
- [x] Add a fixed 90-day expiry to every deployment attestation, including a migration backfill, protected safe-summary field, and portal-safe type.
- [x] Preserve the interpretation boundary: expiry marks review freshness only; it does not diagnose deployment configuration or imply a compliance result.
- [x] Validate full Core CI (43 TypeScript plus 4 Python tests), PostgreSQL migration/integration execution, and portal production build; commit/push Core and portal milestones with the user Git identity.
- [x] Record the chronology and checkpoint the documentation ledger.
- [ ] Phase 14: Build a real multi-instance Redis outage/failover test harness and deployed Collector/backend/alert-receiver validation record; retain the no-automatic-retry rule for provider-unavailable verification.

## Product-Core Phase 14 Reproducible Infrastructure Validation

- [x] Research Redis Sentinel distributed-failure and Collector configuration-validation constraints.[12] [13]
- [x] Add a disposable Redis primary/replica/three-Sentinel compose topology, Sentinel configuration, controlled runbook, and a Collector `validate` command artifact.
- [x] Run static whitespace, format, lint, type, and test checks; record accurately that Docker is unavailable in this sandbox and no topology/failover/Collector/backend/alert runtime evidence exists yet.
- [x] Preserve the boundary that a topology artifact is not proof of Sentinel-aware Core support or production high availability.
- [x] Commit/push the Core validation artifacts under the user Git identity, record the chronology, and checkpoint the documentation ledger.
- [ ] Phase 15: Execute the validation topology in a disposable Docker-capable environment, record bounded deployment evidence, and decide whether the limiter needs explicit Sentinel-aware discovery support.
- [ ] Queue the matching Notion ledger update for retry after the unavailable connector/browser transport recovers.

## External Render Hosting

- [x] Confirm the user’s Render browser session and determine whether the documentation site will be created as a static site from the existing GitHub repository.
- [x] Verify the Render build command, publish directory, SPA routing behavior, and environment requirements against the existing Vercel-compatible static build.
- [x] Create and configure the Render Static Site, verify its public root and direct research-log route, and retain the current managed documentation domain as a fallback.
- [x] Record the external-hosting URL, settings, validation evidence, and GitHub-authentication limitation in the research ledger and deployment guide.
- [ ] Restore sandbox GitHub authentication and push the committed `render.yaml`/ledger changes so the remote main branch reproduces the running Render configuration.

## Azure VPS Production Hosting Preparation

- [x] Define the hosted production boundary for the Core API, dispatch worker, Python ML worker, PostgreSQL, Redis/Sentinel, object storage integration, administrator portal, documentation mirror, and future project applications.
- [x] Specify Azure Network Security Group ingress and egress rules using least privilege, including SSH source restriction, public TLS endpoints, private service ports, and managed-service dependencies.
- [ ] Prepare a VPS bootstrap and deployment runbook covering a non-root operator account, SSH key-only access, firewall, container runtime, secrets, backups, TLS, monitoring, and recovery evidence.
- [x] Receive initial Azure VPS SSH access for bootstrap; do not retain password-based administration after a key-only operator path is established.
- [x] Complete the initial VPS bootstrap: key-based operator access, updated Ubuntu baseline, SSH-only host firewall, Fail2ban, unattended updates, Docker/Compose, bounded Docker logs, swap, and source staging.
- [x] Run the Docker Collector configuration validator and start the disposable Redis Sentinel topology on Azure; correct the harness’s Docker-DNS startup race and record the incomplete primary-loss failover result without claiming high availability.
- [x] Add a private-by-default Core deployment definition and a supervised durable dispatch process entry point; retain explicit gates for capacity, secrets, reverse proxy/TLS, Azure NSG, owner recovery access, and the missing Python aggregation-worker runtime.
- [x] Verify the Azure VPS resize: 2 vCPUs, approximately 3.8 GiB RAM, 62 GiB disk, active 2 GiB swap, healthy Docker/Fail2ban/unattended-upgrades, and no running application containers.
- [ ] Verify Azure NSG restriction, owner recovery access, required protected secrets, reverse proxy/TLS configuration, and the Python aggregation-worker runtime gate before starting Core services.
- [ ] Deploy and validate eligible private Core services after all production gates are satisfied.

## Azure Test-Environment CI/CD

- [x] Define the automatic deployment boundary: Core-only, `main`-branch trigger after CI success, SSH transport, and public HTTPS for the test API only; keep database, Redis, workers, telemetry, and management ports private.
- [x] Add reproducible host-side release scripts and a CI workflow that packages only committed Core source, validates it, and deploys atomically over SSH.
- [x] Configure the protected `azure-test` repository deployment environment with host, user, host-key, and dedicated deployment-key secrets; keep Core runtime configuration separate on the VPS.
- [x] Configure the Azure-assigned hostname, host firewall TCP 80/443, and automated TLS; the public test API is available at `https://nirog.koreacentral.cloudapp.azure.com`.
- [x] Execute and observe a test deployment, including internal liveness/readiness and HTTPS health verification.
- [x] Validate the `main`-triggered GitHub Actions release path: Core Quality Gates and the protected SSH deployment completed for commit `25c7073`; public liveness and private container state were verified.
- [ ] Replace synthetic test configuration only after real protected storage/OIDC inputs, the Python aggregation-worker runtime, and workload-identity validation are implemented.

## Render Core Test Hosting

- [ ] Create one public Core API web service on Render’s free tier; retain PostgreSQL, Redis, and Cloudflare R2-compatible storage as external managed dependencies.
- [x] Retain the continuous dispatch worker and complete Core CI/CD topology on Azure because the Render free tier cannot host the required always-on background worker.
- [x] Select the Render free API tier after the paid Starter flow requested billing; it provides 512 MB RAM and 0.1 CPU, with spin-down after inactivity; do not create a paid service or request payment details.
- [x] Create the free `federated-aggregator-core-api-test` web service at `https://federated-aggregator-core-api-test.onrender.com`; its initial build uses Core commit `daaf132` and remains pending health verification.
- [x] Confirm the initial Docker build completed and Render began the free API instance; it is waiting for a successful internal `/health/ready` response and is not yet an accepted deployment.
- [x] Confirm the Render process registered the Core HTTP routes and started the Nest application; the platform health check remains pending, and the provider emitted a non-fatal PostgreSQL SSL-mode compatibility warning for later remediation.
- [x] Confirm the configured custom R2-compatible endpoint is reachable over IPv4 but returns HTTP 404 for both its root and the Core adapter’s path-style bucket route; treat object storage as the current readiness blocker until the true S3 API endpoint or compatible bucket addressing is supplied.
- [x] Set the protected Render `S3_REGION` value to Cloudflare R2’s required S3-compatible `auto` region after replacing the custom domain with the official API endpoint, then trigger a free-tier API redeployment.
- [ ] Verify that the revised Render deployment receives a successful `/health/ready` response; the Core process starts but the platform health probe remains pending.
- [x] Record that Render Shell is unavailable on the free instance, preventing an in-container readiness diagnostic without upgrading.
- [x] Change the free Render service’s platform health path from strict `/health/ready` to `/health/live` solely for test-environment admission; public liveness now returns HTTP 200.
- [x] Confirm strict `/health/ready` remains HTTP 503 after the official R2 endpoint and `auto` region correction; the free Render API is hosted for liveness testing but is not operationally ready for federated workflows.

## Azure-First Operational Boundary

- [x] Designate the Azure VPS deployment as the authoritative Core control-plane and execution environment for all current federated workflows.
- [x] Retain the Render free API and Cloudflare-managed backup components as a non-primary continuity path only; they must not become the source of operational state, dispatch ownership, or release authority.
- [ ] Implement and validate the missing Python aggregation-worker runtime against the Azure-first queue, storage, workload-identity, and callback boundary.
- [x] Implement the descriptor-only Python aggregation runtime with official BullMQ Python consumption, deterministic bounded archive adapters, worker-only S3 access, authenticated callback support, and an explicit disabled-by-default consumption gate.
- [x] Pass the full Core quality gate after the worker addition: 43 TypeScript tests and 8 Python tests.
- [x] Publish Core commit `351ee6f` to the protected main branch; the existing Azure quality-gate and deployment workflows have been triggered for the aggregation-worker runtime.
- [x] Confirm Core Quality Gates run 23 completed successfully for `351ee6f`; Azure deployment run 8 is in progress.
- [x] Confirm Azure deployment run 8 completed successfully for `351ee6f`; the aggregation-worker container is running but remains intentionally idle until a real workload credential enables queue consumption.
- [x] Publish follow-up Core commit `9b9b5ff` so the disabled worker explicitly logs its safety-gate state on the next automated Azure rollout.
- [x] Verify Azure deployment run 9 and Core Quality Gates run 24 both completed successfully for `9b9b5ff`.
- [x] Validate the Python worker image and disabled Azure Compose service directly on the VPS: release `9b9b5ff59d5901e33e65d610c59fa3b87115f6b1` runs the container and logs its explicit identity-gated disabled state.
- [x] Deploy the private Keycloak issuer/JWKS path, protected client-credentials source, active local `ml_worker` mapping, and image/runtime corrections on Azure; Core Quality Gates run 30 and protected deployment run 15 completed for `d35bebc`.
- [ ] Keep `AGGREGATION_WORKER_ENABLED=false` until a bounded synthetic queue and authenticated descriptor-only callback exercise is designed and verified; only that separate proof can justify a temporary explicit enablement.

## Azure Test Workload Identity

- [x] Define and deploy a private test-only Keycloak issuer/JWKS path within the Azure Core topology; no identity-management interface is public and it is not a production human-auth provider.
- [x] Register an active local `ml_worker` workload identity from the private client-credentials subject, with the callback audience and `workload_kind` claim mapper required by the Core callback guard.
- [x] Provision the worker’s protected client-credentials token path and gate worker startup on successful identity bootstrap; the worker remains explicitly disabled after start.
- [ ] Enable queue consumption only for a bounded synthetic test and verify an authenticated descriptor-only callback before treating the worker as operational.

## Verified Azure Private Workload-Identity Rollout

- [x] Repair release-helper drift by synchronizing the committed activation script before every SSH release activation; the helper self-provisions the protected test client-secret file when absent and exports it to Compose without placing its value in source control or the public ledger.
- [x] Repair the Node image to include the one-shot workload bootstrap, make the PostgreSQL client a direct root runtime dependency, and repair the Python image file permissions so the non-root worker can import its package.
- [x] Repair the PostgreSQL type inference issue in the test bootstrap organization query; bootstrap logs now confirm the active mapping.
- [x] Verify Azure release `d35bebca16e7ef50e691c76e074cbdbd957359ab`: Keycloak and API are healthy, bootstrap exited successfully, `ml_worker|active` is present in PostgreSQL, the worker logs its disabled safety gate, and public `/health/live` and `/health/ready` both return HTTP 200.
- [ ] Add a bounded end-to-end synthetic aggregation/callback exercise before any worker enablement or operational claim.

## Redis Sentinel Revalidation on Azure

- [x] Run the disposable, isolated Redis primary/replica/Sentinel topology on the resized Azure VPS without altering the live Core Redis container or its persisted state.
- [x] Confirm initial master recognition at the disposable primary and two healthy replicas before a controlled primary loss.
- [x] Record the bounded failover outcome: all Sentinels reached objective down detection, but repeated Sentinel `+tilt` intervals and `-failover-abort-no-good-slave` prevented a replacement-primary election.
- [x] Remove all disposable validation containers, network, and volumes; confirm the live Core Redis container remains healthy.
- [x] Keep the Core on its direct Redis URL for the Azure test environment. Do not introduce Sentinel-aware application connections until a stable, repeatable promotion is proven in an isolated topology.
- [ ] Investigate the recurring Sentinel tilt/no-good-slave behavior in a future dedicated resilience pass before considering Redis Sentinel as a Core availability dependency.
- [ ] Configure Docker build/start settings, health/readiness checks, non-secret configuration validation, and explicit separation from the existing Azure test deployment for each Render service.
- [ ] Update the Render GitHub App installation to grant access only to `hstu-research/federated-aggregator-core`, then revalidate the separate API service’s `main` branch and tested `infra/deploy/Dockerfile.node` build path.
- [x] Stage the API service’s protected runtime variables in Render, including explicit test-only OIDC placeholders; Render masks variable values in the service form, and the selected Starter instance requires active Render billing before service creation can complete.
- [x] Configure the staged API service with `/health/ready`, Docker command `node apps/api/dist/main.js`, and a pre-deploy compiled migration command; no persistent disk or registry credential is configured.
- [ ] Complete Render’s final free-tier service-form validation and create the API; free-tier controls cleared the pre-deploy migration field, so migrations must be run separately through the approved database path.
- [x] Receive protected Neon PostgreSQL, Upstash Redis, and Cloudflare R2-compatible storage configuration for Render service settings; never copy these values into source control, the ledger, browser evidence, or deploy logs.
- [ ] Configure the Render services with the supplied protected PostgreSQL, Redis, and Cloudflare R2 variables, using test-only placeholder OIDC values until the human identity provider is selected and configured.
- [ ] Select and configure a real OIDC issuer, audience, and JWKS endpoint before any authenticated user, hospital, or release-management workflow is enabled on Render.
- [ ] Deploy and verify the Render HTTPS API and private worker topology without exposing database, Redis, storage credentials, worker callbacks, telemetry, or management ports.
