# Design Directions

## Three candidate approaches

### Theme Name: Research Ledger

**Very Brief Intro:** An archival technical notebook with warm paper surfaces, deep ink typography, and precise cyan annotations. It makes complex federated-learning decisions feel studied, durable, and reviewable.

**Probability:** 0.07

### Theme Name: Signal Atlas

**Very Brief Intro:** A spatial systems map for a distributed learning network, combining restrained dark navy panels with bright operational signals. It emphasizes flows, version lineage, and active decision points.

**Probability:** 0.04

### Theme Name: Clinical Terminal

**Very Brief Intro:** A high-contrast clinical documentation environment that borrows the clarity of laboratory instruments and the hierarchy of scientific publishing. It is calm, serious, and oriented around evidence rather than decoration.

**Probability:** 0.09

## Chosen approach: Research Ledger

**Design Movement:** Contemporary editorial systems design, influenced by scientific field notebooks, technical standards documents, and high-end research-library interfaces.

**Core Principles:**

1. Put evidence before ornament: every visual element must clarify state, provenance, or navigation.
2. Combine an editorial reading rhythm with compact technical panels so long-form decisions remain easy to scan.
3. Use one strong structural motif—annotated ruled margins and index tabs—rather than generic cards.
4. Show uncertainty visibly through status labels and deliberate muted treatment, never by hiding it.

**Color Philosophy:** The base is a warm paper white that reduces glare during long reading sessions. Near-black ink creates institutional seriousness, while a restrained mineral teal is reserved for active, validated, and navigational signals. Oxide red is used only for cautions, rejected claims, and blocked actions.

**Layout Paradigm:** A reading room: a persistent left index rail, a wide editorial document column, and a slim right evidence margin. Primary pages shift from narrative sections into dense operational inserts instead of uniform card grids.

**Signature Elements:** Numbered chapter tabs, a fine vertical research-rule in the content margin, and evidence stamps such as `PROVISIONAL`, `VALIDATED`, and `BLOCKED`.

**Interaction Philosophy:** Navigation should feel like moving through a carefully indexed report. Hover states are subtle, API controls disclose their safety state before interaction, and destructive API examples are visibly disabled outside the mock/local environment.

**Animation:** Use brief 160–220ms opacity/transform transitions for sidebar selection, API panel expansion, and page-section entry. Respect reduced-motion preferences. Do not animate reading content aggressively.

**Typography System:** Use `DM Serif Display` for page titles and chapter-level claims, paired with `IBM Plex Sans` for navigation, descriptions, and controls. Use `IBM Plex Mono` for API methods, schema names, hashes, and experiment identifiers. Keep a disciplined scale with a large editorial title, a medium section title, and compact technical metadata.

**Brand Essence:** A research control ledger for federated model releases—built for teams that need to trace every decision from local update to approved global model. **Personality:** rigorous, calm, accountable.

**Brand Voice:** Headlines are factual and declarative; CTAs state the operational outcome rather than selling. Example lines: “A global model is a release, not a score.” and “Every accepted update leaves an auditable trail.” Generic filler such as “Welcome” or “Get started” is prohibited.

**Wordmark & Logo:** A ledger-mark composed of three offset vertical rules intersected by one rising aggregation line, with the wordmark “AGGREGATOR / LEDGER” set in compressed uppercase mono. The graphic mark must work alone as the favicon.

**Signature Brand Color:** Mineral Teal — `#0D7C78`.

## Style Decisions

- Documentation is the first product and must read like a living research record, not a marketing landing page.
- The API reference uses mock/local safety states and visibly disables destructive calls in documentation mode.
- Provisional research outcomes are preserved in place with explicit evidence stamps.
- Long research-log pages use visible chapter clusters so the chronology reads as an indexed archive rather than an undifferentiated feed.
- Documentation chronology pages carry a slim right-side provenance margin with evidence language and state treatment, balancing the persistent left index rail.
- The ledger mark and `AGGREGATOR / LEDGER` wordmark are rendered as a compact institutional archive signature, not as incidental navigation text.
- The primary ledger mark uses three offset vertical rules intersected by one rising aggregation line; generic node-network motifs are reserved for explanatory diagrams only.
- Every primary documentation route follows the reading-room structure with a persistent index, editorial document column, and visible provenance or evidence margin.
- Repeating content groups use ruled ledger inserts, margin labels, and status stamps rather than generic rounded marketing cards; mineral teal remains an operational evidence signal.
- Long chronologies use named archival chapter breaks with a visible index range, rather than a uniform chronological feed.
- The Research Log evidence margin is a second spine: every entry carries a bounded proof-state label, state treatment, and record number in a ruled margin panel.
- Oxide red visibly marks blocked, failed, rejected, and cautionary evidence; mineral teal remains reserved for validated, active, and navigational evidence.
- The ledger mark and compressed `AGGREGATOR / LEDGER` wordmark recur as an institutional archive seal in the left rail and Research Log header, rather than appearing as isolated navigation branding.
- Research Log chapter clusters use dark index tabs, volume labels, visible index ranges, and stronger ruled divisions so the chronology reads as a bound ledger rather than a uniform feed.
- The evidence margin carries proof-state, semantic status stamp, record number, and chronology label as mandatory evidence infrastructure; titles, stamps, metadata, and body text follow a deliberately scan-first editorial hierarchy.
- Hospital Node document records use named archival volumes with a dedicated provenance lane per volume; generic document rows remain a quiet substrate beneath the ruled tab, range, status stamp, and evidence context.
